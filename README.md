# component-library-testing

A collection of component library testing. Sometimes testing in the UI is "labeled" as unnecessary, because if we can test in browser, why should we automate it? I wrote a blog post about it, hopefully it can be useful: https://imballinst.dev/blog/making-testing-in-frontend-fun.

Imagine if you have a UI for a particular complex feature. To test the feature end-to-end, you need at least 30 minutes worth of testing time. Sure, you may have Quality Assurance (QA) engineers to test them for you. However, as software engineers, why don't we make their tasks easier? By writing tests and ensuring we've covered all cases in the UI so we can make sure that the UI is more robust.

This repository contains how to test components from different packages, which hopefully can be useful.
